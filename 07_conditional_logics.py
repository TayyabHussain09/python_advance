#greater than and equal to operator is >=




#is 16 equil to the 16
print(16==16)
print(16!=16)
print(16<16)
print(16>16)
print(16<=16)

#application of logical opeerations
usama_age=5
age_at_school=6
print(usama_age<age_at_school) #simply this will tell true and false according to requirements as used in the netflix about age related facts

#input function and logicals

age_at_school=6
student_age=input("how old is the student") #here input function
student_age=int(student_age)   #here it was necessary to change the age in the integar from string
print(student_age==age_at_school)  #here logical operator
